# Transport-Demand-Prediction
In this project i have build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, for a specific route date and time. There are 14 routes in this dataseta and all of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

This resulting model can be used by Mobiticket and bus operators to anticipate customer demand for certain rides, to manange resources more efficiently and to offer promotions and sell
